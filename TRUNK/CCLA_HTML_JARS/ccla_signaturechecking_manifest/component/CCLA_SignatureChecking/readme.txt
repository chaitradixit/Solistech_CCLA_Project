V1.0.10 26/05/2011
-----------------
- Minor Change - Slimmed down bundle page UI

V1.1.0 (01/07/2011)
-------------------
- Related persons displayed in the Signature Checking panel has been expanded to
  list persons with other relations to the account (not just 'Signatory') This is 
  controlled by the env. var CCLA_SC_SIGNATORY_RELATION_NAME_IDS.
  
V1.1.1 (08/08/2011)
-------------------
- Removed LWDocument(dID) constructors in favour of LWDocument(dID, true) to ensure
  direct database lookup is used, as opposed to GET_SEARCH_RESULTS. Many times more 
  efficient. Also replaced LWDocument(dDocName) with LWDocument(dDocName, true)

V1.1.2 (26/09/2011)
-------------------
- Run the following update script:
  - person_signature_updates_26092011.sql
- Prevented capture of signature images from static data pages, if the new 
  CCLA_SC_RequireSourceDocId flag is set. When set, signatures can only be captured
  in Iris.
- The assumed source document ID (dID) where a signature was captured from is now
  stored in the PERSON_SIGNATURE table as SOURCE_DOC_ID. This parameter is enforced
  if CCLA_SC_RequireSourceDocId flag is set.
- Prevented capture of signature images from non-transaction documents in Iris, if the
  new CCLA_SC_PreventTransactionCapture flag is set.  
- Added 'signatureCaptureAllowed' binder flag when the getIsSignatureCheckRequired()
  method is called. This flag is only added to the binder for non-transaction 
  documents.
