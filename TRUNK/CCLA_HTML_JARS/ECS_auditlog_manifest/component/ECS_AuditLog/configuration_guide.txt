The audit component uses configuration settings in the database to determine whether a
successfully executed service should be audited.

The database configuration consists of 3 tables, the exact configuration will depend on
the application being audited and the environment it is running in (for example if two
separate applications are being audited extra configuration will probably be required
to ensure that audit entries can be determined for each application).

The configuration tables are:

tAudit_ServiceMapConfig
tAudit_FixedMapConfig
tAudit_BinderMapConfig

tAudit_ServiceMapConfig- maps services to audit actions
=================================================
This table consists of 4 columns:
AC_SERVICE - the Oracle UCM service to be audited
AC_ACTION - the audit action (AACTION) that corresponds to the AC_SERVICE
AC_BINDER_FIELD/AC_BINDER_VALUE - (optional)

Use the AC_BINDER_FIELD/AC_BINDER_VALUE fields if you want to check the binder for specific
information before deciding on whether to audit or the type of audit action.  For example
if AC_BINDER_FIELD is set to xComment and and AC_BINDER_VALUE is set to 'Audit me please'
the audit component will only audit the AC_SERVICE if the binder contains the xComment 
field with the data 'Audit me please'.

Note: You can match to multiple field values by using the special token '*' in the
AC_BINDER_VALUE field.  In the example above setting AC_BINDER_VALUE to '*' would ensure
that the AC_SERVICE will be audited if the xComment field contains any data (i.e. it isn't
null or zero-length).

tAudit_FixedMapConfig- maps audit fields to fixed values
==================================================
This table consists of 3 columns
AC_FIELD - the audit field (e.g. AAPP)
AC_VALUE - the value to apply to the audit field
AC_ACTION - (optional) if not set the AC_FIELD/AC_VALUE combination is assumed to be a
default and will be applied to all audit actions.  If set to an audit action then this
field/value combination is applied just to that action.

Note: You can override a default field/value setting for a specific action by adding a new
line with the action and its particular field/value settings.

tAudit_BinderMapConfig- maps audit fields to values in the binder
===========================================================
This field consists of 3 columns
AC_FIELD - the audit field (e.g. AAPP)
AC_BINDERFIELD - the field in the binder whose value should be applied to the audit field
AC_ACTION - (optional) If set then the configuration is applied to the action otherwise the
configuration is assumed to be a default and applies to all actions.  (This works just like
the AC_ACTION field on the AUDIT_FIXEDMAP table).

Note: A binder map configuration will override a fixed value map configuration. (e.g. if a
fixed map of AAPP->MyApp is created this will set the AAPP audit field on all audit actions
to MyApp.  If a binder map entry AAPP->AppFieldValueInBinder is added this will then
override the fixed map setting and AAPP will now be set to the binder value of the
AppFieldValueInBinder field.
