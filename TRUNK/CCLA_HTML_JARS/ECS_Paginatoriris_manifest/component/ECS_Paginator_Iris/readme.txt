ECS_Paginator_Iris Component
============================
Tom Marchant

Description
-----------

Very similar to the ECS_Paginator component. However, the standard
paginator component has since been updated and the original version
is preserved here to ensure compatibility with Iris.

Iris requires a special fixed-width paginator for use on the document
approval page - it is styled and presented differently to the standard
paginator.

All the includes have the same name as the standard paginator, except
they are prefixed with 'iris_', allowing the two components to co-exist
without conflicts.
